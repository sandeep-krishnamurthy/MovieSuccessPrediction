negative,"wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time ."
negative,"bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness ."
negative,this film biggest problem ? no laughs .
negative,less-than-compelling documentary of a yiddish theater clan .
negative,"that the chuck norris "" grenade gag "" occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is ."
negative,"viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm's performance , the film would be a total washout ."
negative,"it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental ."
negative,"i can't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents . . ."
negative,"everybody loves a david and goliath story , and this one is told almost entirely from david's point of view ."

negative,"to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato ."
negative,"the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types ."
negative,"the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood ."
negative,an extremely unpleasant film .
negative,"a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned . if you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again ."
negative,a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale .

negative,[at least] moore is a real charmer .
negative,"john carlen's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling ."
negative,"labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film ."
negative,"the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus ."
negative,"stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes ."

negative,"it's a glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that ."
negative,woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody . but i had a lot of problems with this movie .
negative,execrable .
negative,devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special .
negative,"all movie long , city by the sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast ."
negative,plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year .
negative,"however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence ."
negative,"parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place ."
negative,it's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat . but the second half of the movie really goes downhill .
negative,paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre .
negative,the script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair .

negative,"swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent ."
negative,"the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration ."
negative,"see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died ."
negative,suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 .
negative,there are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit .

negative,"peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight ."
negative,amazingly dopey .
negative,a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late .
negative,cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation ( career - kids = misery ) in tiresome romantic-comedy duds .
negative,the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming .
negative,just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole .
negative,"the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication ."
negative,only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of elizabeth berkley's flopping dolphin-gasm .

negative,banal and predictable .
negative,"'yes , that's right : it's forrest gump , angel of death . '"
negative,"a wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching ."
negative,"while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points ."

negative,absurdities and clichés accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel .
negative,"if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick ."
negative,the sheer dumbness of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down .
negative,strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild .
negative,the next big thing's not-so-big ( and not-so-hot ) directorial debut .
negative,"yet another iteration of what's become one of the movies' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally "" superior "" friends , family . . ."
negative,bond-inspired ? certainly . likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ? let's hope not .
negative,this flat run at a hip-hop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines .
negative,"davis has energy , but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly ."
negative,"surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy ."

negative,"responsável direto pelo fracasso 'artístico' de doce lar , o roteirista c . jay cox não consegue sequer aproveitar os pouquíssimos momentos em que escapa da mediocridade ."
negative,"just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation ."
negative,"a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor ."
negative,"the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches isn't exactly endearing ."
negative,"shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives ."
negative,"in the book-on-tape market , the film of "" the kid stays in the picture "" would be an abridged edition"
negative,"ultimately . . . the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults ."
negative,it's just a little too self-satisfied .
negative,clever but not especially compelling .
negative,"mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service ."
negative,"a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable ."
negative,labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public .
negative,the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .
negative,brisk hack job .
negative,the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher .
negative,alarms for duvall's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks .
negative,…the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material .
negative,what little grace [rifkin's] tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics .
negative,tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel .
negative,"unfortunately , kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks "" the four feathers "" bare ."
negative,. . . what a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be

negative,the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare .

negative,. . . bibbidy-bobbidi-bland .
negative,"a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater ."
negative,"bad in such a bizarre way that it's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste ."
negative,there's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie .
negative,hugh grant's act is so consuming that sometimes it's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are .
negative,"although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks ."
negative,"i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama ."
negative,what we get . . . is caddyshack crossed with the loyal order of raccoons .
negative,"the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake ."
negative,"when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger's sex life , it already has one strike against it ."
negative,there are now two signs that m . night shyamalan's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : unbreakable and signs .
negative,. . . hokey art house pretension .
